        Chelsea FC has had several notable shirt sponsors throughout its history. From 1983 to 1993, the club's shirts featured the logo of Commodore, a computer company. Following that, Chelsea struck a deal with Coors, an American brewing company, as their shirt sponsor from 1993 to 2001. The following year, the club signed a record-breaking sponsorship deal with mobile phone company, Emirates, which lasted until 2005.
